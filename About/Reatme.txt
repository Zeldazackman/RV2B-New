   You don't need RimNude or other clothing removers for this; bellies render above everything but outer/shell apparel. Most armor will look a little odd.
   Foxbold also have a patch to let anyone wear their sandcloaks, and graphics are included for all standard body types. They're slightly worse than flak jackets, but they look great with bellies.

   The bulge hediffs are applied on vore record population; there's no need for a new save, or for manual hediff adding, but preds do need to vore something new for bulges to appear.
   Bulges only show up if the hediff is at 0.4 or greater; for humans, this means anything at least the size of a raccoon. It's based on total prey size, so 2 hares work too.
   Bigger races need bigger prey for a bulge, and smaller need smaller; snakes (bodysize 2.0) need slightly less than a wolf, and eevees (bodysize 0.5) just need a single hare.

   Don't worry if you don't have a race listed here; The patches are conditional. They don't even throw up an error.
   This all shouldn't affect TPS that much.

   The aliases have been patched so that Irkin can nom as they don't have stomachs, they have squeedilyspooches. At all times, respect the lore.

   Ferian have been patched to allow grappling.

   Apini and Azuri have optional textures in case you're running the Bumblebee retexture.
   The apron was patched to be on the outer/shell layer, so they render over bellies. This shouldn't affect what they can equip.

   All apparel can be set up to have bulged versions; the only thing stopping it is lack of art. Currently, there's only a few; Parkas, apini aprons and flak vests, and the vessel cloaks and dress.
   No, really, graphics are all that's needed. Check the other .txt.

   If there's a race you'd like support for, let me know. Odds are, they use mostly the same (if not <the> same) body graphics as humans; and thus, the same belly and offsets. Ez pz.
   If you'd like to try, it may <actualy> be as simple as copying Bulges_Human.xml and replacing "Human" as needed.
	You'll need to check if they have a alienPartGenerator/bodyAddons portion of their race def, and edit accordingly.

   Rim-Vali dosn't use HAR. They're immune to vore bulges. I tried messing with them, and it requires transpiling the RimValiCore .dlls.

   If you're better at art than me (you are), feel free to resprite, help with bulge equipment, anything you want. Idgaf.

   The hediffs in question, and what body parts/vore types they cover are -

	RV2B_BellyBulge (stomach, intestines, womb, overies, torso)
	RV2B_StomachBulge (stomach)
	RV2B_IntestineBulge (intestines)
	RV2B_WombBulge (womb, overies)
	RV2B_TestiesBulge (testicles)
	RV2B_BreastBulge (breasts, cleavage)
	RV2B_TailBulge (tail, tail throat)

		The bulges are, functionaly, just a HAR bodyaddon. They can be added to any HAR race via something like-
		
		1.4 syntax -
			<hediffGraphics>
				<RV2B_BellyBulge>
				<path>Belly/Empty</path>
					<severity>
						<a0.4>
							<bodytypeGraphics>
								<Male>Belly/Base/Belly_Male</Male>
								<Female>Belly/Base/Belly_Female</Female>
								<Thin>Belly/Base/Belly_Thin</Thin>
								<Hulk>Belly/Base/Belly_Hulk</Hulk>
								<Fat>Belly/Base/Belly_Fat</Fat>
							</bodytypeGraphics>
						</a0.4>
					</severity>
				</RV2B_BellyBulge>
			</hediffGraphics>
		
		1.5 syntax -

			<extendedGraphics>
				<Hediff For="RV2B_BellyBulge">
					<path>Belly/Empty</path>
					<extendedGraphics>
						<Severity For="0.4">
							<BodyType For="Male">Belly/Base/Belly_Male</BodyType>
							<BodyType For="Female">Belly/Base/Belly_Female</BodyType>
							<BodyType For="Thin">Belly/Base/Belly_Thin</BodyType>
							<BodyType For="Hulk">Belly/Base/Belly_Hulk</BodyType>
							<BodyType For="Fat">Belly/Base/Belly_Fat</BodyType>
						</Severity>
					</extendedGraphics>
				</Hediff>
			</extendedGraphics>

		- in their <bodyAddons> section.

	Severities should go in descending order.
	(eg: <a0.8>
	     <a0.6>
	     <a0.4>
	)	

	Severity goes from 0 - 2; 1 is same size, 2 is double size.

	BellyBulge is the catch all for most "normal" vore.
	Lamia, for instance, could use StomachBulge and IntestineBulge to move prey from the human bits to the snek bits as they pass through.
	Make sure you don't combine them too much; if you're using Stomach, Intestine or WombBulge, BellyBulge is gonna look weird.
	If you feel there's something missing, just let me know.

	I appologize for adding 7 invisible hediffs to your pawns.

   Bellies sometimes fail to update, especialy if the pawn is off-map (or eaten) or their body isn't being rendered (beds). This is a purly visual HAR issue, and fixes itself after a little while.

   	-Bellies won't show up!
		[ Only the races listed above have patches; other races don't have bulges. ]
		If there's one you desperatly need, let me know; or, give a hand at your own patch. They're not too hard to make, and a lot of races can use the default belly.

		[ Bellies only show up for the, uh, well, belly. ]
		Turning someone into tailstuffing or being in the middle of swallowing will not give you a belly. Prey have to be in the [ stomach, intesines, womb or torso ].
     		Also, prey need to be big enough. For a human (bodysize 1.0), raccoons (bodysize 0.4) or bigger are needed; for eevees (bodysize 0.5), hares (bodysize 0.2) are good enough.
		It's cumulative, so 4 rats will work too.
		There's only 1 belly graphic, but more could be added (if I were better at art /shrug)

		[ If you can't even have the bulge hediff show up in dev tools, there's a conflict going on. ]
		Specificaly, something making the hediffclass for HediffDef.RV2B_Bulge come up null, making the hediff fail to load.
		There's not much to do here other than systematicly going through mods untill it goes away. Disable half, check, disable half, check...
		If you find a mod that conflicts, send me to it. I might be able to figure it out.
	
	-How do I make bulged apparel?
		Bulged apparel need a _bulged.png version of the apparel, placed in the same file path as the original apparel .pngs.
		For instance, for the Flak Jacket, the original texture is in Textures/Things/Pawn/Humanlike/Apparel/FlakJacket/FlakJacket.

		4 textures for each bodytype are needed; in the Flak Jacket's case; 
			FlakJacket_<bodytype>_bulged, FlakJacket_<bodytype>_bulged_east, FlakJacket_<bodytype>_bulged_south, FlakJacket_<bodytype>_bulged_north.

		You can also set up race specific graphics, too; FlakJacket_<bodytype>_<pawnrace>_bulged
		The mod checks if <apparel>_<bodytype>_bulged exists, and applies the graphics as long as the bulged hediff is large enough.
		
		Check the apperal included for an example.



   If any mod authors deem their race's inclusion in this problematic, let me know and I'll cut support. I swear, I mean no disrespect.


   Now please tell Calypso that she's a very good belly animus vox, and that Rut appreciates every single one of her belly nuzzles very much.
