
	When the apperel patcher looks at the BellyBulge hediff, it multiplies it's severity by 5 and then floors it.

	This gives it the number 1 at 0.2 severity, 2 at 0.4, and so on, aligning with the severity thresholds in the race patches.

	File names are set up like this; <base>_<racename>_<bodytype>_bulged_<size>

	Racename and size are optional (<base>_<bodytype>_bulged is the minimum)

	<base> is the normal file name for the apparel graphics.
	<racename> is the pawn's race defname (Human, Anthro, Alien_Cutebold, eg)
	<bodytype> is the pawn's bodytype (Male, Female, Thin, Hulk, Fat)
	<size> is 1 - 10. 5 is where a pawn's prey is as large as they are.

	If <apperel_path>_<pawn_bodytype>_bulged exists in the files (eg, for a female flak jacket; Things/Pawn/Humanlike/Apparel/FlakJacket/FlakJacket_Female_bulged)
	  then the graphics are replaced as long as the hediff is strong enough.

	If <apperel_path>_<pawn_bodytype>_bulged_<severity_mod> exists (eg, hings/Pawn/Humanlike/Apparel/FlakJacket/FlakJacket_Female_bulged_1)
	  then graphics are set accordingly; severity_mod is 1 at 0.2 severity, so on.

	<racename> can be used to set up graphics for specific races, in case your favorite colonist looks odd.

	Only the standard BellyBulge hediff is used for right now. I'm trying to find a good way to incorperate the others.
